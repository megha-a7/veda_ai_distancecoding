      "Hare Krishna! Gently motherly advice on how to control anger can be found in the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 63: \"For the one who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his mind will remain the greatest enemy.\"\n",

      "The mind is powerful, and when it is not kept in check, it can lead to anger. To control your anger, you must first conquer your mind. Concentrate on your breath and practice mindfulness to help you keep your mind in check. When you feel your anger rising, take a few moments to pause and reflect on the situation. Remind yourself that anger will not help the situation and practice kindness and compassion towards yourself and others.\n",
